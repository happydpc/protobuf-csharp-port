"Protocol Buffers" is a binary serialization format and technology, released to the open source community by Google in 2008.

There are various implementations of Protocol Buffers in .NET. This project is a fairly close port of the Google Java implementation.

There are two main parts:

`ProtoGen.exe`, which takes binary representations of protocol buffer descriptors (as generated by the "stock" protoc binary supplied by Google) and creates C# source code. This is only required at build time.

`Google.ProtocolBuffers.dll`, which is a supporting library. This is required at execution time.

As of April 2011, all development for this project will be performed in the [Google Code Mercurial repository](http://code.google.com/p/protobuf-csharp-port/source/checkout); the old [GitHub project](http://github.com/jskeet/dotnet-protobufs/tree/master) is obsolete.

There is API documentation available [here](http://help.protobuffers.net/), which can also be downloaded as a [CHM file](http://help.protobuffers.net/protobuf-csharp-port.chm).
